# Triennial Thesis Repository: Exploring Counterfactual Explanations in AI

Welcome to the repository for my triennial thesis in Computer Engineering! This project delves into the fascinating realm of **counterfactual explanations** applied within Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems.

## Overview
In recent years, AI has made remarkable strides, but the opacity of some AI models has raised concerns regarding their trustworthiness and accountability. To address this issue, my thesis focuses on **counterfactual explanations**, a promising approach for enhancing transparency and interpretability in AI systems.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this thesis are as follows:
- **Investigate** the concept of counterfactual explanations and their significance in the context of AI.
- **Develop** methodologies for generating meaningful counterfactual explanations tailored to different AI models.
- **Evaluate** the effectiveness of counterfactual explanations in enhancing the interpretability of AI systems through empirical studies and user feedback.

## Key Contributions
Throughout this project, I aim to make the following key contributions:
- **Theoretical Framework**: A comprehensive exploration of the theoretical foundations of counterfactual explanations, including their philosophical underpinnings and practical implications in AI.
- **Methodological Innovations**: Novel algorithms and techniques for generating insightful counterfactual explanations applicable across various AI domains.
- **Empirical Validation**: Rigorous experiments and case studies demonstrating the utility and efficacy of counterfactual explanations in real-world AI applications.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:
- **Code**: Contains the implementation of algorithms and methodologies developed as part of the thesis project.
- **Data**: Includes datasets used for experimentation and evaluation purposes.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation outlining the theoretical background, methodology, and usage instructions for the provided code.
- **Results**: Compilation of experimental results, visualizations, and analysis reports.

## Get Involved
I encourage fellow researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts to explore, critique, and contribute to this repository. Your feedback and contributions are invaluable in advancing our understanding of counterfactual explanations and their role in shaping the future of AI.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to my thesis advisor, colleagues, and mentors for their guidance, support, and valuable insights throughout this journey.
